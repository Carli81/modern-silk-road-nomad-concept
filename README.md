# Modern Silk Road Nomad Concept
Ideas for a more people centric modern silk road.

## Preface
Historically, an important component of the ancient silk road were the people who traveled on it, creating friendships and connecting cultures, fostering multicultural understanding and sharing not only luxury goods, but crucially technology, knowledge and ethics. Traveling along the ancient silk road meant to experience each culture along the journey from Asia to Europe for a prolonged time, and therefor to immerse oneself into their worlds, to eventually understand their needs.
